Flight booking project

Developed a flight booking website using React.js for frontend and Spring Boot for backend, implemented REST APIs via controllers to handle data exchange between client and server. Utilized Java bean classes and JPA repositories to interact with a MySQL Database. Designed a visual seat selection feature based on the actual flight's seat layout, allowing users to make seat selection.Integrated JWT-based authentication to enable stateless and scalable session management, and applied BCrypt hashing to securely store and validate user credentials in the backend.
